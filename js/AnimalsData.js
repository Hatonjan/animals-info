		name         : "SNAKE",
		description  : "Snakes are legless, carnivorous reptiles in the suborder Serpentes, distinguishable from legless lizards by the absence of eyelids and external ears. As ectothermic amniotes covered in overlapping scales, many snake species have flexible skulls with more joints than their lizard ancestors, allowing them to consume prey larger than their heads.",
		description1 : "Snakes' paired organs, such as kidneys, are aligned front to back to fit their narrow bodies, and most possess only one functional lung. They inhabit every continent except Antarctica and can be found in various environments, including oceans where sea snakes are common. Over 20 families of snakes exist, comprising approximately 3,400 species, ranging from the tiny 10 cm thread snake to the large reticulated python, which can reach 6.95 meters (22.8 feet). The extinct Titanoboa cerrejonensis was even longer, measuring 13 meters (43 feet).",
		description2 : "Believed to have evolved from burrowing or aquatic lizards during the Jurassic period, snakes' modern diversity appeared in the Paleocene, around 66 million years ago. Most snake species are nonvenomous and either constrict or swallow prey whole, though some venomous species can pose a danger to humans."

		alt1 		 : "An image of a crocodilia",
		name 		 : "CROCODILIA",
		description  : "Crocodilia, also known as Crocodylia, is an order of large, predatory, semi-aquatic reptiles. These creatures first appeared approximately 83.5 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous period and are the closest living relatives of birds. Together, crocodilians and birds are the only known survivors of the Archosauria group.",
		description1 : "The broader clade Pseudosuchia, which includes all crocodilians, emerged around 250 million years ago in the Early Triassic period and diversified throughout the Mesozoic era. The order Crocodilia comprises true crocodiles (family Crocodylidae), alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), as well as gharials and false gharials (family Gavialidae). While the term 'crocodiles' is often used to refer to all members of this group, a more precise term for these reptiles is 'crocodilians.'"

		name 		 : "LIZARD",
		description  : "Lizards are a diverse group of squamate reptiles, with over 6,000 species found across all continents except Antarctica, as well as in most oceanic island chains. This group, traditionally classified as the suborder Lacertilia, includes all living members of the Lepidosauria (reptiles with overlapping scales) that are neither sphenodonts (such as tuatara) nor snakes; they represent an evolutionary grade.", 
		description1 : "While snakes are recognized as part of the Toxicofera clade, from which they evolved, sphenodonts are considered the sister group to squamates, which is a larger monophyletic group that includes lizards and snakes."

		name 		: "TURTLE",
		description : "Turtles are reptiles belonging to the order Testudines (also known as Chelonii) and are characterized by a unique bony or cartilaginous shell that develops from their ribs, acting as a protective shield. In American English, the term 'turtle' can refer to the entire order, while in British English, it usually refers to freshwater and sea-dwelling members of this group.",	
		description1 : "The order Testudines includes both living and extinct species, with the earliest known members dating back 157 million years, making turtles one of the oldest groups of reptiles—more ancient than snakes or crocodilians. Of the 327 known species alive today, some are considered highly endangered."

		description : "The domestic cat (Felis catus or Felis silvestris catus) is a small, usually furry, domesticated, and carnivorous mammal. They are often called housecats when kept as an indoor pet or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines. Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and their ability to hunt vermin."

		name 		 : "DOG",
		description  : "The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris or Canis familiaris) is a domesticated member of the canid family that has been selectively bred for thousands of years for various behaviors, sensory abilities, and physical traits. While it was once believed that dogs originated from wild canid species, such as the dhole, golden jackal, or gray wolf, extensive genetic studies conducted during the 2010s reveal that dogs actually diverged from other wolf-like canids in Eurasia around 40,000 years ago.", 
		description1 : "As the oldest domesticated animals, dogs have developed a unique bond with humans, making them particularly attuned to human behavior. Additionally, they can thrive on a starch-rich diet, which would not be suitable for other canid species."

		alt1 		 : "An image of a primate",
		name 		 : "PRIMATE",
		description  : "A primate is a mammal belonging to the order Primates (pronounced /praɪˈmeɪtiːz/; Latin for 'prime' or 'first rank'). In taxonomy, primates are divided into two distinct lineages: strepsirrhines and haplorhines. These creatures evolved from ancestors that lived in the trees of tropical forests, and many characteristics of primates are adaptations for life in this complex three-dimensional environment. Most primate species are at least partially arboreal.",
		description1 : "With the exception of humans, who inhabit every continent, most primates are found in tropical or subtropical regions of the Americas, Africa, and Asia. Their sizes vary significantly; for instance, Madame Berthe's mouse lemur weighs only 30 grams (1 ounce), while the eastern lowland gorilla can weigh over 200 kilograms (440 pounds). Based on fossil evidence, the earliest known true primates, represented by the genus Teilhardina, date back approximately 55.8 million years.", 
		description2 : "Additionally, an early close relative of primates, known from abundant remains, is Plesiadapis, which existed during the Late Paleocene, around 55-58 million years ago. Molecular clock studies indicate that the primate lineage may be even older, potentially originating near the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, or around 63 to 74 million years ago."

		description : "A mouse (plural: mice) is a small rodent characteristically having a pointed snout, small rounded ears, a body-length scaly tail and a high breeding rate. The best known mouse species is the common house mouse (Mus musculus). It is also a popular pet. In some places, certain kinds of field mice are locally common. They are known to invade homes for food and shelter."

		name 		 : "AMERICAN FLAMINGO",
		description  : "The American flamingo (Phoenicopterus ruber) is a large species of flamingo that is closely related to the greater flamingo and the Chilean flamingo. It was previously considered the same species as the greater flamingo, but this classification is now widely regarded as incorrect by organizations such as the American and British Ornithologists' Unions, due to insufficient evidence.", 
		description1 : "Although it has also been referred to as the Caribbean flamingo, this name is problematic because the species is found in the Galápagos Islands as well. Notably, the American flamingo is the only flamingo species that naturally inhabits North America."

		name 		 : "ATLANTIC PUFFIN",
		description  : "The Atlantic puffin (Fratercula arctica), also known as the common puffin, is a seabird belonging to the auk family. It is the only puffin species native to the Atlantic Ocean; two related species, the tufted puffin and the horned puffin, are found in the northeastern Pacific.", 
		description1 : "The Atlantic puffin breeds in various locations, including Iceland, Norway, Greenland, Newfoundland, and many islands in the North Atlantic, extending as far south as Maine in the west and the British Isles in the east. This species has a large population and a wide distribution, and it is not considered endangered, although there may be local declines in numbers.",
		description2 : "On land, the Atlantic puffin displays the typical upright stance characteristic of auks. In the water, they swim on the surface and primarily feed on small fish, which they catch by diving underwater and using their wings for propulsion."

Most of the 60 species of eagles are from Eurasia and Africa. Outside this area, just 14 species can be found – two in North America, nine in Central and South America, and three in Australia."

		description1 : "This order is divided into three superfamilies: Psittacoidea (the 'true' parrots), Cacatuoidea (cockatoos), and Strigopoidea (New Zealand parrots). The highest diversity of parrots is found in South America and Australasia."
