#  Animal Info Gallery  
_A responsive website built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and jQuery templates_

##  Overview  
This project is part of the **Responsive Web Development and Design Specialization**. It showcases a dynamic, responsive gallery of animals using Bootstrap for layout and styling, and jQuery templates for rendering structured data. The site displays information about a variety of species, including reptiles, mammals, birds, and more.

##  Featured Animals  
- Snakes  
- Crocodiles  
- Lizards  
- Turtles  
- Cats  
- Dogs  
- Primates  
- Mice  
- American Flamingo  
- Atlantic Flamingo  
- Atlantic Puffin  
- Eagle  
- Parrots  

##  Technologies Used  
- **HTML5** – Semantic structure and accessibility  
- **CSS3** – Custom styling and layout tweaks  
- **Bootstrap** – Responsive grid system and components  
- **JavaScript** – DOM manipulation and interactivity  
- **jQuery** – Template rendering and dynamic content injection  

##  Project Structure

├── css/              # Custom stylesheets

│
└── index.html        # Main entry point of the site
```

##  How It Works  
- Animal data is stored in `AnimalsData.js` as a structured JavaScript object or array.
- jQuery templates dynamically render each animal’s name, image, and description.
- Bootstrap ensures the layout adapts across screen sizes for mobile, tablet, and desktop users.

##  Learning Outcomes  
- Practiced responsive layout techniques using Bootstrap  
- Implemented dynamic content rendering with jQuery templates  
- Organized project files for clarity and scalability  
- Strengthened understanding of semantic HTML and modular CSS  

##  Future Improvements  
- Add filtering by animal type or habitat  
- Integrate accessibility enhancements (e.g., alt text, ARIA roles)  
- Convert jQuery templates to React components for modern scalability  
- Include animations or transitions for smoother UX
