#  Animal Explorer  
A responsive website built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and jQuery templates

##  Overview  
This project is part of the **Responsive Web Development and Design Specialization**. 
It showcases a dynamic, responsive gallery of animals using Bootstrap for layout and styling, 
and jQuery templates for rendering structured data. The site displays information about a 
variety of species, including reptiles, mammals, birds, and more. While the project is based on a 
template provided by the course instructor I have implemented a custom design to enhance 
the User Experience. The web application is designed to be friendly for young users that often 
show more curious abut different animals.

##  Featured Animals  
- Snakes  
- Crocodiles  
- Lizards  
- Turtles  
- Cats  
- Dogs  
- Primates  
- Mice  
- American Flamingo  
- Atlantic Flamingo  
- Atlantic Puffin  
- Eagle  
- Parrots  

##  Technologies Used  
- **HTML5** – Semantic structure and accessibility  
- **CSS3** – Custom styling and layout tweaks  
- **Bootstrap** – Responsive grid system and components  
- **JavaScript** – DOM manipulation and interactivity  
- **jQuery** – Template rendering and dynamic content injection

```

##  How It Works  
- Animal data is stored in `AnimalsData.js` as a structured JavaScript object or array.
- jQuery templates dynamically render each animal’s name, image, and description.
- Bootstrap ensures the layout adapts across screen sizes for mobile, tablet, and desktop users. 

##  Future Improvements  
- Add filtering by animal type or habitat  
- Integrate accessibility enhancements (e.g., alt text, ARIA roles)  
- Convert jQuery templates to React components for modern scalability  
- Include animations or transitions for smoother UX
